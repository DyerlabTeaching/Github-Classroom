## Setting Up GitHub Classroom 

The following things are probably more appropriate for you if you are setting up an instance of GitHub Classroom.

- [Setup](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Github-Classroom/setup.html) of the Google Classroom environment for a class.
- [Assignments](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Github-Classroom/assignments.html) added to the classroom. Each assignment is its own GitHub repository.
- [Assessment](https://dyerlabteaching.github.io/Github-Classroom/assessment.html) of student work through cloning and pushing with feedback.

## Setting up a Personal Access Token

GitHub has recently moved from using username/password combinations for your repositories to personal acccess tokensâ€”this is a good thing as it provides another layer of security for you, separating your GitHub account information from the authentication process you use to work with your repositories.  If you have not set up your personal access token, follow the instructions [here](https://dyerlab.org/posts/2022-08-25-github-pat/).
