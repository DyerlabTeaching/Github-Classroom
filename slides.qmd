## What is Git

Git is a distributed *versioning system*


:::{.incremental}
- Easy for collaboration.  
- Easy track changes in your projects, documents, and code.  
- Complete history of all changes.
- Easily revert to previous instances.
- Project Based.
- Branching
:::


## Lifetime of a Document

Consider a single file.  After the first edit, you now have two differents ones.  

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
```


:::{.fragment .fade-in}
In Google Docs, you can see the version history (and revert) while in Word you can use track changes to see edits but revisions are more complicated...
:::


## Persistence through Diffs

What we **do not do** is keep multiple versions of the file around as complete files.  What is done is that the original document and only the changes made to the file—called *diffs*—are saved.

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
![](media/diff.png)
:::


## Lifetime of a Document

Add a new figure to the file and now you have three different entities.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
  B -->|New Figure| C[File v3]
```


## Lifetime of a Document

Perhaps the figure did not work out, and you decided to replace it with an image.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
  B -->|Figure| C[File v3]
  B -->|Table| D[File v4]
```

For each new "revision", you create a separate instance of the file itself.


## Lifetime of a Document

Continue editing and making revisions.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
  B -->|Figure| C[File v3]
  B -->|Table| D[File v4]
  D -->|Edited| E[File v5]
```


## Lifetime of a Document

Eventually, you finish making revisions to the file.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
  B -->|Figure| C[File v3]
  B -->|Table| D[File v4]
  D -->|Edited| E[File v5]
  E -->|Submitted| F[Thesis!]
```

:::{.fragment .fade-in}
**Git** allows you to have access to the entire *history* of the file and can *revert* to any of the previous version you want to.
:::


## Lifetime of a Document

Not all documents are incremental. Submitting for publication requires a different layout, citation format, etc. than for your thesis.  Both of these are derived from *File v5* as different *branches*.

```{mermaid}
graph LR
  A[File v1] -->|Edited| B[File v2]
  B -->|Figure| C[File v3]
  B -->|Table| D[File v4]
  D -->|Edited| E[File v5]
  E -->|Submitted| F[Thesis!]
  E -->|Submitted| G[Publication]
```



## Git in Projects

This is a process that can include hundreds of files, data sets, images, shapefiles, etc.  It is a *Project Based* approach.  

And the entire project is referred to as a **Repository**.


## Remote Locations

A git repository can live in many places.

:::{.incremental}
- On your laptop  
- On the lab computer  
- On a thumb drive (please do not use these any more)  
- On your home computer
- On you iPhone
:::

## Synchronizing Repositories

Having a single remote **Repository** allows you to keep all the remote repositories in sync.

:::{.incremental}
1. Establish Repository on [GitHub](https://github.com).  
2. **Clone** that repository to your local computer.
3. Make changes.
4. **Commit** changes when you are at a logical stoping point.
4. **PUSH** the one or more committed changes to [GitHub](https://github.com).
5. On other computers with *local* copies, you **PULL** changes from [GitHub](https://github.com) to retrieve any changes you've made.
:::


## Pulling & Pushing.

For all these computers, you need to make sure you are *pushing* changes to [GitHub](https://github.com) from your current machine so that when you get to the next computer you can *pull* down these changes.


## Collaborations

With a [GitHub](https://github.com) repository, several people can contribute to the same project and have access to the same content.

:::{.incremental}
- Can lead to conflicts
- Merging files
:::


## [GitHub](https://github.com)


# {background-image="media/github.png" background-size="initial"}




# Github Classroom  {background-color="black" background-image="media/contour.png" background-size="initial" background-position="right"}




## Github Classroom

Just like "Canvas" but using Git and Github For interactions.

## Assignments

Each 'Assignment' is located in its own GitHub Repository.

:::{.incremental}
- Each individual must be *registered* with the class (e.g., I need your GitHub login).
- One source of data, documents, etc.
- I will post a link to the GitHub Classroom assignment on Canvas. 
- You **clone** the assignment and it makes a special version for you.
- You work on it and when you are done (or want to get some feedback), you **push** it back to GitHub.
- In GitHub, the code can be examined and commented on.  Any changes I make are then pushed back and you can see them.

## Example Assignment Workflow

## Example Assignment Workflow

You will work on the assignment.  Commit changes as necessary.  And when you are finished, you will push it back to the original repository.

## Comments and Feedback

GitHub Classroom has the ability to facilitate feedback and chat based upon each push and commit. The dialog box here opens this ability.

## Dialog 

Which can include all kinds of feedback.

## More In-Depth Evaluation

Some—OK almost all—assignments are more complicated and need more than just a visual inspection of a text/markdown file.

:::{.incremental}
1. Instructor can clone your repository.
2. Run code and render output.
3. Provide feedback and assessment.
4. Push back to repository.

## Questions

::: {layout-ncol="2"}
If you have any questions, please feel free to either post them as an "Issue" on your copy of this GitHub Repository, post to the [Canvas](https://canvas.vcu.edu) discussion board for the class, or drop me an [email](mailto://rjdyer@vcu.edu).
